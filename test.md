This is a step-by-step process to update the SW and configure the Vision
AI Dev Kit (codename Peabody). This document will cover instructions
from connecting hardware, setting up IoT Edge to configuring a basic
object detection AI model for viewing the results through HDMI display
and RTSP streaming.

Tools required before starting:
===============================

-   **ADB**: Download the ADB command-line tool for
    [Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip),
    [MAC](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip)
    or
    [Linux](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip).

-   **QFIL (part of QPST)**: QFIL is the application for Windows to
    install or flash stock firmware on devices using Qualcomm Chipset.
    Download from [Qualcomm
    CreatPoint](https://createpoint.qti.qualcomm.com/tools/#suite/285/27224)
    (available to existing licensees). (MSFT internal users use [this
    link](https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/Selfhost-VisionAIDevKit/Shared%20Documents/General/Tools/qpst.win.2.7_installer_00480.14.zip).)

-   **7-Zip**: Download the 7-Zip file archiver. (from
    [here](https://www.7-zip.org/))

Validate PC is connecting to the device
=======================================

Connect the USB-type C cable from your windows PC to the camera.

Use command *adb devices* from your CMD prompt to see if the is
detected.

*Tip: Long press the button behind Peabody device will trigger
hardware-reboot that may rescue you from being stuck.* *The* *long
pressing the white button at the back to reboot may not work
consistently because of ongoing SW changes. If your device has a hole on
the left side, press it and it will trigger power off. Then click on the
white button at the back again will make it power on again.*

Downloading and Extracting the latest Device Firmware 
======================================================

Setup the IoT Hub and your IoTEdge Device
=========================================

Follow the steps on this
[page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-register-device-portal)
to create your IoT Hub and add a IoT Edge device.

> **NOTE**: Offline mode
>
> You can setup your device to work in offline mode. Follow the steps on
> [[this]{.underline}](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/offline-capabilities)
> page.

a)  IoT Hub Region must be any where IoT Hub is available, except East
    US and West Europe

b)  ~~Set environment variable **UpstreamProtocol** = **MQTT** for
    edgeHub and edgeAgent~~

<!-- -->

13. When creating your **IoTEdge** device in the [Azure
    portal](https://portal.azure.com), avoid using a device you have
    used before. Do not reuse the connection string on multiple devices.

    ![](media/image13.png){width="5.0079997812773405in"
    height="1.6423611111111112in"}

14. Copy the Connection string (primary key)

    This is the unique identifier for the device. You will need this
    string to configure your device.

Setup the default Object classification module
==============================================

\[debugging steps / tips & tricks\]
===================================

In CMD prompt type the following commands to check docker container
status

-   *adb shell*, use

-   *docker ps* or *watch docker ps*

If **edgeAgent** is still being downloaded, you will see it empty. To
check if it's in progress, you can use *watch ifconfig wlan0* and see if
the RX bytes is growing.

If **edgeAgent** is downloaded, you will see it running here. Once you
see edgeAgent is downloaded, you can type *docker logs -f edgeAgent* to
see its progress. Now the device is ready to deploy a module from IoT
Hub.

You can use *docker logs -f edgeAgent* to see the logs and progress of
the Edge Agent.

After you see "Start module \<your module name\>" message then you can
use docker logs -f \<your module name\>

Get IP address of the device using *adb shell ifconfig wlan0*

TROUBLESHOOTING::

a.  Running inferencing on CPU (this will give better accuracy as DSP
    doe snto work very well due to quanitization)

    1.  Change your va-snpe-engine-library\_config.json by setting below
        2 fields to 0

        1.  \"NetworkIO\":0

        2.  \"Runtime\":0

b.  How to run on camera that never connects to internet

    a.  Download this image on your pc from here

#### KNOWN ISSUES

1.  HDMI: use a direct HDMI connection to the display. Using converters,
    e.g. DP port, will usually not work.

2.  Stability: the neural processing engine (or other parts of the
    stack) will crash from time to time. *adb reboot* will help to reset
    all sub systems.

3.  Incorrect labels: the labels presented on the HDMI output are
    incorrect. The display process picks the label of the last object
    that was detected and presents it to the UI. This is not an
    inferencing bug. *logcat \| grep SNPE* will show you the inferenced
    objects.

4.  Offline mode: iotedged fails to start after reboot if it cannot find
    WiFi.
