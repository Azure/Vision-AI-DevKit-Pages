    <td width="50%">
    
This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a Vision AI DevKit device provisioning itself with Azure IoT Central services to enable the live reporting of telemetry, state, events, and settings with the ability to manually control the ML model. This project can be considered a proof of concept of IoT Edge device's integration with IoT Central before IoT Central officially supports IoT Edge devices.

<b> Implementation </b> </td></tr>

<tr><td>
This project is implemented as a NodeJS micro service and React Web client. The web client allows the user to interact directly with the device to control it as well as experiment with Custom Vision AI models.

This project has potential for BLANK industries; for example, the use of IoT Central with the Vision AI DevKit camera can be used to BLANK to ensure BLANK.
