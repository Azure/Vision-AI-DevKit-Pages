## What you will do

* Train a model using Azure Machine Learning and Azure Notebooks. Deploy the model to your Vision AI Dev Kit device

### Pre-requisites

* Vision AI DevKit camera
* Azure Machine Learning workspace

### Clone example GitHub and Get Started
<!--
* Log in to [Example GitHub](https://notebooks.azure.com/tedway/projects/vision-ai-dev-kit ){:target="_blank"} and clone it
* ![Clone GitHub]({{ '/assets/images/ANB_github_clone.PNG' | relative_url }})
-->
* Clone or download the example GitHub contents (link in the top menu) 
* Login to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/){:target="_blank"} and upload the contents to your Azure Notebook


### Prep your environment

* Change the aml_config/config.json file to match the subscription details for your Azure ML Workspace
* In case you want to use your own data go to the data folder and create a folder with your data, e.g. my_data. 
  * In the my_data folder, copy your data.  Each folder name is the label of the images in that folder.  For example, the soda_cans folder looks like this:  
    * soda_cans 
    * coke 
    * ice 
    * pepsi 

* IMPORTANT: You MUST upload more than 35 images per folder so thereâ€™s enough data for training. 

### Run the notebook

* Open the 02-mobilenet-transfer-learning-final.ipynb notebook 

* Set the Kernel to Python 3.6

![Set kernel]({{ '/assets/images/NVM_set_kernel.PNG' | relative_url }})

* Run the notebook by running each cell individually

![Run notebook]({{ '/assets/images/ANB_run.PNG' | relative_url }})

* In case you don't want to run a cell you can change it to markdown

![Markdown cell]({{ '/assets/images/ANB_markdown.PNG' | relative_url }})

### Configure your IoT Hub details

* Change the cell content to reflect your IoT Hub. Please note that you can use format:
  * Iot_hub_name="youriothub"
