<table><tr><td><b>Summary</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
This project uniquely utilizes the Vision AI Developer Kit to aid in training a Neural Network based on features extracted from audio files. In this sample use case, the water level of a fountain can be determined by using audio classification through a machine learning model based on the sound produced by water splashing into a larger volume of different depths. This demonstrates both how audio can be used in some cases as a cheaper alternative to vision with 360° field coverage that is still possible using the DevKit and how to train a model using the Azure Machine Learning Service.  <br> </td></tr>

<b> Future Improvements and Project Suggestions </b> </td></tr>
<tr><td>
This sample demonstrates one very linear way to train a model in a very controlled environment with just a few thousand audio files.  Future improvements might include: <ol>
<li>Modifying the AudioCapture module to read and write TWINs</li>
<li>Modifying the AudioInferece module to include updates for audio modules</li>
<li>Modifying the Label script to use a small model to later label non linear sample files</li>
<li>Modify the AudioCapture module to collect files and incorporate the pipeline capability of the Azure Machine Learning Service</li>
</ol>

  Feel free to fork the project and contribute back any improvements or suggestions. Contributors and maintainers are encouraged.
