## What is a community project?

Developers using the Vision AI DevKit to build solutions can share their progress as a community project. Included in a community project is typically a **repository** of any code produced, **screenshots or videos** of the program functionality, and a **description** of the goal of the project and how it works!<br><br>

You can view our selection of community projects <a href="https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/projects/" target="_blank">here</a>.
