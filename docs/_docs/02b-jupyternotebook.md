### Jupyter Notebooks and Azure Machine Learning

- Jupyter Notebooks provide an easy way for training machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning services. Azure Machine Learning services enables you to prepare data and train models. You can then convert the trained model to the custom DLC format and package into a IoT Edge module to deploy to the Vision AI Dev Kit.
- You can try training with example data (soda cans) or easily bring your own data

### Options for running the notebooks

1) Local installation
 - In order to run Jupyter Notebooks locally we recommend following the [VS Code setup instructions]({{ '/docs/SetUp_VS_Code/' | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}. Jupyter Notebooks installation is a part of Anaconda instructed with the VS Code setup. 

2) [Notebook VM]({{ '/docs/notebookvm/' | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}

3) [Azure Notebooks]({{ '/docs/azurenotebook/' | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} provides free online access to Jupyter notebooks running in the cloud on Microsoft Azure
