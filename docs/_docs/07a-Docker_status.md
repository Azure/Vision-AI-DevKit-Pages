## Check Docker Container status

Use the command line

```
adb shell docker ps
```

or

```
adb shell watch docker ps
```

* If edgeAgent is still being downloaded, you will see the docker container is empty. To check if itâ€™s in progress, you can use the command line

    ```
    adb shell watch ifconfig wlan0
    ```

  to see if the RX bytes are increasing.
* If edgeAgent is downloaded, you will see it running. Once you see edgeAgent is downloaded, you can use the command line

  ```
  adb shell docker logs -f edgeAgent
  ```

  to see the progress. Once completed, the device is ready to deploy a module from IoT Hub.
