    excerpt: |
      [Get up and running in minutes](https://aka.ms/VAIDKGetStarted-Landing/), regardless of your current skill level with vision machine learning.
      # Build fast
      * New to Vision ML? Waiting for your DevKit? Start building a vision model, letting [Azure Custom Vision Service](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/Create_Train_Vision_ML_Project/){:target="_blank"} do the heavy lifting.
      * Experienced with vision ML? Use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Visual Studio Code](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/SetUp_VS_Code/) to create and train custom vision ML models.

      # Deploy fast
      [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/Deploy_Model_IoT_Hub/){:target="_blank"} can push your containerized vision ML models to the Vision AI DevKit with ease, whether the camera is on your desk or in another country.

      # Build the intelligent edge
      As an [Intelligent Edge device](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/future-of-cloud/){:target="_blank"}, the Vision AI DevKit can be combined with [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/){:target="_blank"} to deploy vision ML models and custom business logic from the cloud to the edge via standard containers. Moving these workloads to the edge of the network means vision ML inferencing work requires less cloud interaction while enabling quick reaction to local events, including operating during extended offline periods.
