    excerpt: |
      Get up and running in minutes using the [tutorial project](https://aka.ms/VAIDKGetStarted-Landing/), regardless of your current skill level with vision machine learning.
      # Build fast
      * New to Vision ML? Waiting for your DevKit? Let [Azure Custom Vision Service](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/Create_Train_Vision_ML_Project/){:target="_blank"} do the hard work, starting with only a few labeled images.
      * Experienced with vision ML? Use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Visual Studio Code](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/SetUp_VS_Code/) create and train your custom vision ML models.
      * Already have a vision ML model? Convert and deploy models from many existing formats.

      # Deploy fast
      [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/Deploy_Model_IoT_Hub/){:target="_blank"} can push your vision ML models to the Vision AI DevKit with ease, whether the camera is on your desk or in another country.

      # Intelligent Edge: Fast local processing, backed by the power of the cloud 
      As an [Intelligent Edge device](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/future-of-cloud/){:target="_blank"}, the Vision AI DevKit runs your vision ML models locally for fast image inference. You can add business logic to your concept, sending only the most important data to the cloud for more advanced processing and response.

        As an Azure IoT starter kit, the Vision AI DevKit can use the [Azure Machine Learning service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/) to build, train and deploy AI models. Packaged into containers, these models are executed on the camera using [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/).<br><br><br>
